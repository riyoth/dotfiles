# gitup -- Script that checks if a file .<name> exists in $HOME (for
#          every file and dir in the current working directory) and
#          copies it into the current directory. Intended to be used
#          as a helper while keeping dotfiles in git. Based on the
#          idea and implementation by Uli (psychon) Schlachter.
